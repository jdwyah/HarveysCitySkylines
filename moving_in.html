	<h2>A Place To Live</h2>
	<p>Nobody will live in our city if they don't have places to build their houses. A place to build their houses is the residential zone.</p>

	<h2>Where should I put the residential?</h2>
	<p>Next to a road and near a water pipe and a electric line. There doesn't need to be an electric line next to every house because Cities skylines automatically installs undergrund electric lines, if the houses are close enough, with no costs to you!</p>

  <h2>How much residential should I zone?</h2>
	<p>About half of your space. Make sure to have your commercial zones at least a road away. Also make sure there is at least ten blocks of space between your industrial and your other types of tiles so your other tiles don't get polluted.</p>

  <h2>Demand Bars</h2>
  <p>
  Possibly the most important thing to look at are these three bars at the bottom left of the screen. This tells you what your residents want for zoning. The types of zoning are low density commercial, low density residential, industry, office, high density residential, and high density commercial.

      <p>Our residents would like some commerce! (that means they need to buy some things)</p>

  <h2>What about the commercial zones?</h2>
  <p>When your citizens need somewhere to shop, indicated by the blue bar, they should take up enough space to make the blue bar go down to a normal level: about an eighth of the way up the bar.</p>

  <p class="info-msg">
    <i class="fa fa-info"></i>
    Demand is good! It's better to have some demand, than none at all. If there is no demand for commercial, all of your existing stores will be fighting over the same customers. This can end up in a situation where they will go out of business. Closed stores are then more likely to have crime and property values are reduced.

    So don't feel like you need to react at the first sign of demand don't build too much too quickly.
